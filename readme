# Customer Sales Conversion

You will analyze customer behavior on a commercial website and create a supervised machine learning model to predict whether visiting a website will result in a purchase.

## Background

Commerce websites often record visits to analyze customer behavior. One important aspect of customer analytics is whether a visit to the website results in a sale. An e-commerce agent might analyze how long visitors stay on the website, how many pages they visit, what types of pages they visit, and whether they make a purchase. Such information can be used to predict whether a visit will result in a purchase. 

## Instructions

1. Import the data into a Pandas DataFrame and examine the column names and their descriptions.

2. Next, analyze the data to retrieve the following information:

  * The number of visits for each month.
  * The number of visits that resulted in a sale.
  * The percentage of visits that resulted in a purchase.

3. Filter the DataFrame for all purchase:

  * What is the number of visits for each month that resulted in a purchase?
  * Which month had the greatest number of visits in which a purchase was made?
  * How many visits were from returning visitors?
  * How many visits were from new visitors?
  * How many visits took place on a weekday?
  * How many visits took place over the weekend?

4. Next, perform logistic regression to predict the behavior of future visitors to the website, 
  * Use the testing data to make predictions.
  * Print the classification report of the model's performance.
