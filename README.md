# Customer-Conversion-Sales-Analysis
## Websites for commerce frequently keep track of visits to study user
behavior. Whether a visitor makes a purchase after seeing the website is an
important factor in customer analytics. The length of time visitors spend on
the website, the number of pages they view, the variety of pages they view,
and whether they complete a purchase are all things that an e-commerce
agent might examine. It is possible to determine if a visit will result in a
purchase using this information. In order to determine if a website visit will
result in a purchase, this project analyzes client behavior on a business
website and develops a supervised machine learning model.
